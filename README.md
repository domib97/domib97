Hello human being!

The Name my parents gave me is Dominik Boehm (Böhm)
and the earliest childhood passion I still have memories of was to open up old radios or microwaves to somehow understand these mysterious black-boxes. 

I still have this eager to learn and therefore spend most of my free time with watching educational YouTube-Channels (VSauce,Veritasium,Kurzgesagt,Joe-Scott). 
Sometimes I also read some random book I found on the sidewalk or go hiking in the forest. 

My current rabbit hole is a DIY e-bike and researching the buzzwords: (Cardano-)Blockchain,
web3, DAO, metaverse, NFT, eUTXO, proof-of-stake, smart contracts.

Before  my apprenticeship as a systems engineer at USU, I studied 4 semesters aerospace engineering at
FH Aachen - University of Applied Sciences and after that 6 semesters electrical engineering. 

I was not happy about my current state of living and learning so I someday decided to join the SWITCH-project that originated here in Aix-la-Chapelle to begin my 3 year long training as a college dropout in the german dual education system.

I'm looking forward to shape the IT-future with all the friendly people I will meet in the the next time!


Best regards
